# rest-demo
A Spring-Boot application to demo Restful web services using Spring MVC, and an Angular JS client.

Deployed demo URL : http://fierce-retreat-62806.herokuapp.com/

##Running the application

You need JDK 1.8 installed to run this application.

Once that basic requirement is filled, you can run the application using maven by running this simple command *`mvn spring-boot:run`*

##Server
Server side rest operations can be accessed by the `/company` namespace.

###Functionality
The application uses a simple in-memory datastore instead of connencting to a database to store the data. This would of course mean that once you restart the application all data is wiped clean.

####Model

The application manipulated a *Company* object. A company has the following attributes.
* Company ID
* Name
* Address
* City
* Country
* EÂ­mail (Optional)
* Phone Number (Optional)
* One or more beneficial owner(s)

####Rest operations

The application allows 5 operations.

1. Add a company.
  All the mandatory fields must be present for the request to succeed.
  * HTTP Method : `POST`
  * Rest URL : `/company`

2. Edit a company.
